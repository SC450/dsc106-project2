        Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization?

      <h2>Proposition: NYPD officers are more often cleared of allegations than found guilty, with incrimination rates remaining proportional over time.</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/figure1.png" alt="A line plot that shows rates of officer substantiations over the years." />
          <figcaption>This plot shows that complaints resulting in officer substantiations and those not resulting 
            in substantiations have grown at similar rates over time. The "No Action Taken" line consistently stays 
            above the "Action Taken" line, and the gap between them remains roughly proportional throughout.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Title and description: I made sure to use language that would be in support of the proposition. Using 
            the phrase "no one is above the law" creates an engaging and eye-catching title, and I honestly gave a 
            description of the plot in the description. I would rate this decision's earnestness as 1.5.</li>
          <li>Annotations: I really wanted this visualization to agree with the proposition's point that both lines 
            grow proportional to each other, so I emphasized the proportional growth with orange arrows, which show 
            the scalar by which you can multiply the value at the "Action Taken" line to reach the value at the "No 
            Action Taken" line. Additionally, I added text which restates that both complaint types accumulate 
            proportionally to each other. I would rate this decision's earnestness as 2.</li>
          <li>Color: I chose colors that would stand out from each other and be unique. The blue color for the 
            "No Action Taken" line is a calm and neutral color, while the red color for the "Action Taken" line
            is a more aggressive color. I chose the arrows to be orange, as orange is distinguishable from both 
            blue and red, and clearly emphasizes the proportionality between the two lines. I would rate this decision's
            earnestness as 2.</li>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/figure2.png" alt="A line plot that shows the rates of officer incrimination over the years." />
          <figcaption>This plot shows that the rate of complaints filed resulting in officers being arrested or summoned to court has grown greatly in recent years, with these type of complaints overtaking the number of complaints where no action was taken in 2005.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Grouping and aggregation: I created the "No Action Taken" and "Action Taken" categories by grouping
            similar values together for each category. For example, values in the "Action Taken" category include
            arrests of any kind, as well as summons of any kind. This makes the category of NYPD officers who have 
            done wrongdoing look larger than it would be if I had separated the arrests and summons into two separate 
            categories. I have also been intentionally vague in naming the "Action Taken" category, and I avoided using
            the words "arrests" or "summons issued" to make this plot have the same labels as the above persuasive plot.
            This forces the reader to read more closely to identify that the "Action Taken" category encompasses arrests
            and court summons, as described in the description of the plot. I would rate this decision's earnestness as -1.5.</li>
          </li>
          <li>Title and description: I made sure to use negative language in my title to persuade the reader that more
            recent years have seen a greater number of NYPD officers being punished for their actions. Using the phrase
            "modern generations of NYPD officers are failing themselves" catches the reader's attention by utilizing a
            negative connotation. I also stated in my description that the rate of complaints in which there is no action
            taken has "fallen behind", emphasizing the idea that NYPD officers have become more troublesome over time. 
            I would rate this decision's earnestness as -1.</li>
          </li>
          <li>Annotations: I wanted to emphasize that modern generations of officers have been more problematic than
            officers of past years, so I annotated the plot with an orange line at the year 2005, which is when the
            "Action Taken" line overtakes the "No Action Taken" line. I also added an arrow and text annotation
            to make this point clear. The orange line serves a "divisor" between the older and newer years, and makes it 
            easy to see that both lines have clearly not been growing proportionally to each other. I would rate this decision's
            earnestness as 1.5.</li>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>Designing both visualizations was both easier and harder than I had expected. I had a clear vision of what 
          I wanted both visualizations to argue for, but I encountered difficulty in finding deceptive techniques I could
          use in my plot against the proposition. I wanted to make both visualizations look very similar to each other so 
          that it would not be immediately obvious to the reader what the deceptive technique was. This is why I used the same
          colors for each plot, as well as the same axes and labels. This makes the plots look very similar to each other, even
          though they are arguing for different sides of the proposition, forcing the reader to look more closely at the plots
          to identify the differences, which can be found detailed in the description of the plots. The labels "Action Taken" and 
          "No Action Taken" are the same for both plots and are intentionally vague, as I wanted to use the same labels for both 
          plots despite both plots conveying different meanings. "Action Taken" and "No Action Taken" are broad, general terms that 
          still correctly describe the data, but do not give the reader the full picture of what the data is actually showing. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I was surprised by how different conclusions could be drawn depending on which columns of the data were shown, and how
          data was grouped. In my visualization for the proposition, I used the "board_disposition" column, grouping data based on
          whether or not values contain the string "substantiated". Similarly, in my visualization against the proposition, I used the
          "outcome_description" column, grouping data based on whether or not values contain the string "arrest" or "summons issued". 
          After grouping the values for both columns, I had thought that "board_disposition" and "outcome_description" would have roughly 
          the same distribution of "Action Taken" and "No Action Taken", as I thought substantiations would correspond to an equal amount of
          arrests and summons issued, and unsubstantiated complaints would correspond to an equal amount of no action taken. However, this is 
          not the case, as shown by the two visualizations. This taught me that although two columns may seem similar, they can have completely
          different distributions of values.
          <br>
          <br>
          After making my deceptive visualization, I realized that honesty and clarity are important when analyzing and visualizing
          data ethically. Using ambiguous labels in data visualizations can trick the reader into interpreting data from a warped perspective,
          biased depending on what the visualization is arguing for. I have also discovered that language plays a significant role in affecting
          how a visualization can be viewed, as language with strong connotations can easily sway the reader into agreeing with a visualization's 
          argument. A bound that I would draw to distinguish acceptable persuasive choices vs. misleading ones is using unambiguous labels that 
          accurately describe the data, while still using language that is engaging and eye-catching. Using broad terms can hide facts about the data 
          from the reader, which starts treading into misleading territory. I think transparency in how data is grouped is also another important
          boundary between acceptable and misleading persuasive choices. Avoiding elaboration on how data is grouped and labeled can lead the reader to 
          believe that a category of data is bigger or smaller than it actually is, and makes the visualization deceptive. I do not think that it is 
          necessary for the reader to understand the fine details of the data grouping process, but the reader should be able to understand what kind of 
          values fall into what category and for what reason.
